  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: August 13, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Overview</h2>
  <p>Forever Connected AI is a voice-based emotional companion app. It allows users to speak freely, receive reflective AI responses, and review emotional tone analytics. We are committed to protecting your privacy, and this policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your control over that data.</p>

  <h2>2. What Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Audio Recordings:</strong> Temporarily stored in memory during processing; not saved or archived.</li>
    <li><strong>Transcripts:</strong> Generated from your voice using OpenAI Whisper and used to create responses.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Tone Metrics:</strong> Various metrics to determine emotion, none linked with Google login credentials.</li>
    <li><strong>Session ID or Google User ID:</strong> Used to associate session data or save user memory. No personal profile info is stored. Future versions may enable "remember me" function.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Login (Optional):</strong> Used only to identify the user. We do not access or store your Google account content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To generate AI-based responses tailored to your emotional tone</li>
    <li>To improve the app’s understanding of tone/emotion over time</li>
    <li>To let users optionally continue sessions or revisit previous responses</li>
    <li>To analyse aggregate emotional data anonymously across sessions</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. What We Do NOT Do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No third-party ads</li>
    <li>No selling of your data</li>
    <li>No passive cookies (except required for sessions)</li>
    <li>No background data recording</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>Audio recordings are discarded immediately after processing. Transcripts and emotion metrics may be logged in anonymised CSV form for app improvement and emotional trend tracking. If you log in with Google, your user ID is stored securely but is never shared. Any future versions of the app that record information about your profile, will be stored locally on your device.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>If you’ve logged in with Google and wish to delete your user record, please contact us using the information below.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>Questions or concerns? Reach out to us:</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any major changes will be posted clearly in the app and on this page.</p>
